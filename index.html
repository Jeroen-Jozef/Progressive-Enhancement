    <h2>The story</h2>

    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
        That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
        They said, <q class="villager">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
        The farmer said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
        and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villager">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events.
        You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
        The neighbors then said, <q class="villager">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>
        The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son
        because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villager">Isn’t that great!</q>
        Again, he said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>
    </p>

    <blockquote cite="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/11/06/alan-watts-swimming-headless/">
        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
        whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of
        the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

    <h2>Here is this dialog in the form of a table</h2>
    <table>
        <caption>Table representing the farmer's philosophy.</caption>
        <tr>
            <td>Event</td>
            <td><strong class="good">Good</strong> or <strong class="bad">Bad</strong>?</td>
        </tr>

            <td>Loose a horse</td>

            <td>Avoid war</td>
            <td>Maybe</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p><strong class="good">Good</strong> and <strong class="bad">Bad</strong> are just one perspective.
